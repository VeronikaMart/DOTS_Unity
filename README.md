# DOTS_Unity
Unityâ€™s Data-Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS) is a combination of technologies that work together to deliver a data-oriented approach to coding in Unity. This allows you to build projects that are better suited to your target hardware and are therefore more performant.

DOTS consists of the following elements:

- The Entity Component System (ECS), which provides the framework for coding using a Data-Oriented approach;    
- The C# Job System, which provides a simple method of generating multithreaded code;   
- The Burst Compiler, which generates fast and optimized native code;   
- Native Containers, which are ECS data structures that provide control over memory.
